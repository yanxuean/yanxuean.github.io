用数学去思考.



# TLA+

数学描述 vs 编程的方式描述.
We witnessed first hand the brain washing done by years of C programming.

## 概念

抽象：Simplifying by removing details is called abstraction.

我们想system能work right。 work right 意味着满足某些properties。

TLA+能检查的properties是 conditions on individual executions。
不能检查一些概率的，如99% of executions produce the right answer。 Not a condition on a single execution.

### TLA+下的基本抽象：
- **An execution of a system is represented as a sequence of discrete steps.**

Digital system：
   We can abstract its continuous evolution as a sequence of discrete events.  比如把物理的钟表抽象为按tick运转的。

TLA+ describes a step as a state change.  
An execution is represented as a sequence of states.  
我们叫a sequence of states为a behavior。
一个system有好多个可能的execution(即behavior).

Science models systems by a state changing with time, usually continuously.
We model digital systems by a state changing in discrete steps.

- TLA+ describes a state as an assingment of values to variables.

### state machines

描述state machine:
* What the variables are
* Possible inital values of variables.
* A relation between their values in the current state and their possible values in the next state.


## Math VS program
Math的表达性更强。如：
* Math可以描述不确定性(someNumber)，
* Math可以用variable描述所有。program要通过很多方式来描述(control state, heap, stack)
* Math更关注于算法
* formula有很多特性(无序性，可拆解)
